Conclusion
From the above analysis we can conclude that adding Brownian motion predicted responses as input feature to ANN model will result to a better performance in stock market price predictions. Also it can serve as a regularization term since the addition reduced the performance of the train set and increased the performance of the test set.

Future Work
Further work can be done by adding more than one predicted responses from mathematical models. One could even consider totally replacing the whole input features with the ones generated by mathematical models.
