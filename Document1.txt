Introduction
Stock market time series prediction is gaining significant traction from mathematical analysts, investors and machine learning professionals. Many mathematical and stochastic models have been developed and are all geared toward making better predictions. Brownian motion and Geometric Brownian motion are one of the widely used models in stochastic analysis in making time series prediction, with both having their merits and demerits. 
Many Machine learning algorithms have been employed in these predictions among which Artificial Neural Network stands out due to its capacity to do better on big data than most other Machine learning models. Machine learning models have the capacity of learning from many input data commonly known as input features. The input features for stock market prediction usually include daily open price, daily closing price, daily highest price, daily lowest price, daily volume and daily turnover. The output data is usually the closing price of the next trading day. There are also several ways of generating more features from existing ones like data augmentations. 
This paper presents a new way of feature generation, using the predictions from mathematical models like the predictions from Brownian motion. It proposes either adding it to the existing features or replacing the existing features with it.
The data used for this work is the GOOGLE stock market index which can be downloaded on yahoo Finance and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was used in training the features.
